# GamersCommunity.Core

`GamersCommunity.Core` is the core library of the **GamersCommunity** project.  
It provides the fundamental building blocks, utilities, and abstractions that other modules of the ecosystem rely on.

> Status: **Work in progress**. This repository is public, but external contributions are not currently solicited.

## ✨ Introduction

GamersCommunity aims to simplify the development of game-related services and tools by offering a clean, modular foundation for .NET applications.

This package focuses on solving common cross-cutting concerns:
- Shared domain primitives (errors, results, value objects).
- Consistent configuration & options binding.
- Dependency Injection helpers and extensions.
- Diagnostics: logging helpers and structured logging conventions.
- Utility helpers (guards, pagination, mapping helpers, etc.).

The library is designed to be **lightweight**, **extensible**, and **easy to integrate** in new or existing solutions.
